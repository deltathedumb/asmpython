## [Unreleased]

CPython-parity expansion: making common idioms compile and produce correct
output rather than silent miscompilations.

### Added

- **Container repr for `print()` and `str()`.** `print(x)` / `str(x)` now
  render Python-style output for every built-in container instead of a raw
  pointer or compile error:
  - lists: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b']`
  - dicts: `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`
  - tuples: `(1, 2, 3)`, `(42,)` (trailing comma for 1-tuples), mixed kinds
  - sets: `{1, 2}` / `set()` when empty

  Backed by shared `_runtime_fmt_elem` + `_runtime_{list,dict,set}_repr`
  helpers; tuples are unrolled inline to honor per-slot element kinds.
- **`range()` as a first-class value.** `list(range(n))`, `sum(range(...))`,
  `len(range(...))`, and bare `range(...)` now work (materialized to a
  `list[int]` via `_runtime_range_list`), with 1/2/3-arg and negative-step
  forms. The `for x in range(...)` fast path is unchanged.
- **`str(container)`** stringifies lists/dicts/tuples/sets via their repr.
- **`str.format()`** with a literal format string: positional `{}`
  (auto-numbered), explicit `{0}`/`{1}` (including reuse), and escaped
  `{{`/`}}`. Previously it silently returned `0`.
- **f-string format specs** are honored: `f"{x:.2f}"`, `f"{n:05d}"`,
  `f"{n:x}"` (float `.Nf/.Ne/.Ng`; int `d/x/X/o` with width and zero-pad).
  Specs were previously stripped and ignored.
- **`@staticmethod`** methods are callable on the class
  (`ClassName.method(args)`), with no implicit receiver. `@classmethod` is
  accepted (call/dispatch work; class-state mutation through `cls` pending).
- **Class variables** (`class C: x = 5`, non-`@dataclass`) are static
  constants: read, write, and augmented assignment via `ClassName.x`.

### Fixed

- **Nested-container element types are tracked** through subscript and
  for-loop binding: `people[i]["k"]`, `for p in people: p["k"]` (list[dict]),
  `grid[i][j]` (list[list]), and tuple unpacking `for a, b in pairs`
  (list[tuple]) no longer print raw pointers.

- **`str(int)` / `str(float)` no longer alias a shared buffer.** Storing
  several conversions (e.g. `[str(x) for x in xs]`) previously made every
  element show the last value (`['3', '3', '3']`); each now gets a fresh copy.
- **Lambdas bound to a name are now callable.** `f = lambda x: x + 1; f(41)`
  and lambdas passed as arguments returned `0`; indirect calls through a
  local/global/parameter function pointer now work, and a name-bound lambda's
  call result is typed from its body (so str-returning lambdas print right).
- **`abs(float)`** returns a float again instead of printing its raw bits.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Linux self-host build on Windows** — `build.py` now produces both
  `build\asmpython.exe` (Windows) and `build\asmpython-linux` (Linux ELF) in
  one run. The Linux target is compiled inside WSL using its native `nasm` and
  `gcc`. `build.bat` is now a thin wrapper that invokes `build.py`.

### Changed

- **Toolchain on Windows must be on PATH.** `asmpython.bat` no longer bundles
  or downloads dependencies; it requires `python`, `nasm`, and `gcc` to be
  available on PATH. `_download-deps.bat` now fetches w64devkit instead of the
  WinLibs MinGW bundle.

### Fixed

- **Linux executables now link under modern gcc.** The Linux link step passes
  `-no-pie`; the generated code uses absolute relocations against libc symbols,
  which gcc's default PIE mode rejects.

---

## [1.0.1-hotfix1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **`build.bat`** changed to compile for both Linux and Windows in one run.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`--keep-assembly`** compiler flag — the intermediate `.asm` file is now
  deleted after assembling by default; pass `--keep-assembly` to retain it.
  `--emit-asm` is unaffected and still keeps the file as before.

### Changed

- **`build.bat`** simplified to a single purpose: self-compile asmpython with
  itself to `build\asmpython.exe`. General compilation, `--test`, `--selfhost`,
  and `--run` modes have been removed; use `asmpython.bat` directly for those.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-12

First stable release.

### Added
- **`--target freestanding`** — Multiboot1-compatible flat binary output (`-f bin`)
  via NASM with no external linker. Boots in QEMU with
  `qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel <output.bin>`.
- **Freestanding runtime**: VGA text mode, COM1 serial output (with `\r\n`),
  bump allocator (256 KB heap), 64 KB kernel stack, 32→64-bit long-mode setup,
  identity-mapped page tables (first 16 MB, 2 MB huge pages).
- **`stdlib.sys`** — `exit`, `getpid`, `getenv`, `abort`, `version`, `maxsize`.
- **`stdlib.time`** — `time`, `sleep`, `clock`, `difftime`.
- **`stdlib.random`** — `seed`, `rand`, `RAND_MAX`.
- **`asmlib`** — new comprehensive hardware/network/GUI library package.
  - `asmlib.hardware` — bare-metal port I/O (`in_byte`/`out_byte`/`in_word`/
    `out_word`/`in_dword`/`out_dword`), MMIO, `rdtsc`, `cpuid`, `halt`,
    `disable_interrupts`/`enable_interrupts`, PIC 8259A (`pic_eoi`/`pic_mask`/
    `pic_unmask`), PIT (`pit_set_freq`), PS/2 keyboard (`keyboard_read`/
    `keyboard_poll`), VGA color/cursor helpers. All implemented as inline
    NASM in the freestanding codegen; stub-returns-0 on hosted targets.
  - `asmlib.network` — BSD socket API: `socket`, `bind`, `connect`, `listen`,
    `accept`, `close`, `send`, `recv`, `send_all`, byte-order helpers, address
    helpers, constants (`AF_INET`, `SOCK_STREAM`, `PORT_*`). Helper symbols
    (`_net_bind`, `_net_connect`, etc.) implemented inline in the hosted
    codegens (Linux SysV ABI and Windows x64 ABI).
  - `asmlib.gui` — SDL2 bindings: window, renderer, draw calls (`draw_line`,
    `fill_rect`, `draw_rect`), event pump, timing. Helper symbols
    (`_gui_poll_event`, `_gui_fill_rect`, etc.) implemented inline in hosted
    codegens via SDL_Rect stack allocation and static event-state buffers.
- **`Assembly` class** (stdlib.assembly) — 150+ x86-64 instruction builder
  methods, SSE/AVX, atomics, system calls, full directive set.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — project is now pip-installable (`pip install .`).
- **`examples/`** — curated example programs moved from root into a dedicated
  directory.
- **`docs.html`** — polished single-file reference documentation.

### Changed
- VGA `_vga_putchar` now mirrors all output to COM1 serial (with `\r\n`
  conversion on newlines) so freestanding programs are testable headlessly
  with `qemu … -serial stdio`.
- `_vga_attr` BSS variable controls the current VGA text attribute byte;
  defaults to `0x07` (light-grey on black) when zero.
- Freestanding section ordering fixed: `_load_end` label now correctly sits at
  the last byte of the flat binary (was 78-126 bytes short previously due to
  `.rodata` being laid out after `.data`).

### Fixed
- `str.split(sep, maxsplit)` now honours the `maxsplit` argument.
- `section .rodata` encounter-order in flat binary output: user string literals
  and float constants now fall inside `[load_addr, load_end_addr)` and are
  therefore loaded by the Multiboot1 loader.
