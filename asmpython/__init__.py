"""asmpython: native Python -> x86-64 -> executable transpiler.

The public surface is small and deliberately mirrors what a user writes:

    from asmpython.assembly import asm_func

`@asm_func` marks a function whose body is raw NASM (the compiler emits it
verbatim). The compiler internals live under the private `_compiler`,
`_runtime`, and `_stdlib` subpackages.
